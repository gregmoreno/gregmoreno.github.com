On Javascript, 1–1s, scholarships, bitcoin, and evil things.

*As a developer:*

[Modern JavaScript Explained For Dinosaurs](https://medium.com/@peterxjang/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70)

Even though I’m already familiar with the tools mentioned in the article, this provided me a better understanding of the front-end ecosystem. It also helped that the headline resonated with me :) The article started with doing it old school — just like many of us dinosaurs did decades ago and moved on to modern techniques. It’s like resetting your brain and learning things again but only this time you come out with a better understanding.

On related note, I’m currently taking the [ES6 course by Wes Bos](https://es6.io/). Just finished the Promises module and I say it’s totally worth it.

*As a manager:*

I’m thinking about 1–1s, why we do it and how to make it worthwhile for both parties. 1–1s that turn into status updates that can easily (and more efficiently) be done via email is a waste of everyone ’s time. But if you view 1–1s as an opportunity to create a connection between you and your manager, it is a very effective tool to build great working relationships that will go beyond your current workplace.

Don’t think of it as a meeting but rather a coffee with someone you are eager to know better.

*As a parent:*

My wife and I, together with our Grade 11 son, attended a college scholarship seminar sponsored by my son’s school. The school’s theatre is packed but according to my son, it is just a fraction of the student population that would benefit from it. I wonder why there aren’t that much interest on such an opportunity. My hypothesis is many students (and even parents) think applying for college scholarships is done when you are close to graduation time.

My takeaway from the seminar is that going after the smaller grants (e.g. $500 — $5000) will give you a better chance of hitting your scholarship goals. Why? Because there are so many of them (at least in Canada) and the chance of getting accepted to at least 10 is not unrealistic. Add those amounts and now your college is free. On the other hand, if you aim for the lottery, not only you are competing against the best and the brightest students who found a cure to cancer or ended hunger in Africa, there is just a handful of slots available.

If you’re a teacher or member of the parent council, and if you happen to be in BC Canada, I recommend you book [Brittany Palmer](http://www.keytoscholarships.com/).

*On Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies:*

There is a lot of hype going around and we shouldn’t be shocked if 99% of the cryptocurrencies out there turn out to be scams. Many people don’t know, including those who now call themselves “investors”, that these cryptocurrencies have 2 sides — the money and the technology. What you will often hear is the money side. After all, a headline that says some “kid became a millionaire after investing $100” will always grab our attention.

Of course, as an “investor”, I am happy with the success of the cryptocurrencies but even if the prices go down to zero, the technology (hint: it is not just blockchain) will stay and evolve in the coming years. And that is where the real benefits lie.

Cryptocurrencies are here to stay. But don’t be stupid.

*I’m pondering:*

What if evil is part of life? That the person doing bad things is just doing his job? Like a normal job, some are bad at it, some are doing it really well, and some are simply looking to change job?
On that note, [Mindhunter](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5290382/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) looks to be another interesting series from Netflix. But that has to wait because it is [Stranger Things Season 2](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4574334/?ref_=nv_sr_1) baby.
